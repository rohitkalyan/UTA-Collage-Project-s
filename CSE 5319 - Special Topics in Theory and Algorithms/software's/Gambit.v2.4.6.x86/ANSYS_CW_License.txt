to convey to Licensee any title, ownership, copyright or any
other intellectual property rights in or related to
Program(s), and Licensor reserves all rights in and to the
Program(s) which are not expressly granted in writing by
Licensor to Licensee.  Licensee will not permit the use of

Contract Users.  Licensee will require the Contract User to
agree in writing to (i) use the Program(s) only to perform
internal data processing services for Licensee and (ii) be
bound by terms equivalent to those set out in this Agreement. 
Licensee is responsible for the use of the Program(s) by all

Licensee's own internal data processing purposes and will not
make all or any part of any Program(s) available to any third

application service provider, or providing batch processing
services.  Licensee's license for the use of the Program(s)
is further limited as follows. 
(i) Evaluation License: If, in Licensor's sole discretion
given the totality of the circumstances surrounding
Licensee's provision of the Program(s), Licensee has obtained
the Program(s) for evaluation purposes ("Evaluation
License"), then Licensee will only use the Program(s) for the
purpose of internal demonstration and evaluation, and not for
production or commercial purposes, in order to determine
whether Licensee desires to purchase a license for the Program(s).  
(ii) Educational License: If, in Licensor's sole discretion
given the totality of the circumstances surrounding
Licensee's provision of the Program(s), Licensee is licensing
the Program(s) for educational purposes ("Educational
License"), then Licensee will not use or permit the use of
the Program(s) for commercial purposes, including but not
limited to consulting, and will only use the Programs for: 
student instruction; student projects; student
demonstrations; and research projects that will be published

LICENSOR AND THE CHANNEL PARTNER AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL
WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, OR REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN), WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM(S) OR
ANY PART THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY AND ALL
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS OR SUITABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE
(whether or not Licensor or the Channel Partner and their
respective subsidiaries, affiliates and suppliers knows, has
reason to know, has been advised, or is otherwise in fact
aware of any such purpose), whether alleged to arise by law,
by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course of
dealing.  Section 6 of this Agreement does not apply to
Evaluation and Educational Licenses.     
(b) CERTAIN PROGRAMS CONTAIN LICENSE KEYS OR AN EXPIRATION
DATE BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM(S) WHICH MAY LIMIT THEIR USE AND
REQUIRE LICENSEE TO OBTAIN FROM LICENSOR EXTENSION KEYS OR
ADDITIONAL NETWORK KEYS FROM TIME TO TIME OR TO REINSTALL THE
PROGRAM(S). 
(c) Licensee will be responsible for installation of the
Program(s).  Licensee may make copies of the Program(s) only
as are necessary for Licensee's back-up or archival purposes
of such Program(s).  The license granted to Licensee by
reason of this Section 2 applies to all copies of the
Program(s).  In no event will Licensee remove or modify any
copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained
within the Program(s) and will ensure that such notices are
reproduced within all copies (whether or not authorized to be
made) of the Program(s).
(d) Licensee will not modify the License Key provided with
the Program(s) in any way.  Licensee will not (and will not
attempt to nor allow any third party to or attempt to) adapt,
alter, amend, modify, reverse engineer, decompile,
disassemble or decode the whole or any part of the Program(s)
or translate the whole or any part of the Program(s) into
another language.  To the extent that local law expressly
grants or requires Licensor to grant Licensee the right to
decompile the Program(s) in order to obtain the information
necessary to render the Program(s) interoperable with other
computer programs used or to be created by Licensee, Licensor
will make such information available to Licensee and Licensee
will not decompile (or attempt to do so) the Program(s)
without first requesting such information from Licensor. 
Licensor will have the right to impose reasonable conditions
(such as the imposition of a reasonable fee) for making the
information available.  In order to ensure that Licensee
receives the appropriate information, Licensee must first
give Licensor sufficient details of Licensee's objectives and
other software concerned.  All requests for the appropriate 
information will be given by notice to be delivered in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Licensee may
not create any application programs using the Program(s)
unless otherwise permitted in a separate written agreement
executed by the parties.
(e) Licensee acknowledges that the Program(s) is subject to
the export laws of the United States of America and that the
export, use, transmission or other transfer of the Program(s)
is governed by the laws and regulations of the United States
of America.  Licensee agrees that it will not take, export,
or transmit the Program(s) to any other country, individual
or entity without Licensor's prior written consent, which
consent Licensor may grant or withhold in its sole
discretion.  Licensee will not provide to Licensor any
technical data related to defense articles or services,
including military, space, or satellite end-use without
Licensor's prior written approval.
(f) If applicable, for U.S. Government Users, except as
specifically granted by this Agreement, use, duplication, or
disclosure by the United States Government is subject to
restrictions stated in this Agreement and FAR 12.212 (for
non-DOD licenses.

3.  TERM AND TERMINATION
(a)  Lease Licenses are non-cancelable by Licensee and, at
the end of the License Term, will automatically renew at the
then-current renewal fees for a term equal to the duration of
the immediately preceding License Term unless Licensee,
Channel Partner, or Licensor gives prior written notice of
their intent not to renew no later than 30 days prior to the
end of the License Term.  The Lease License will terminate
automatically upon Licensee's failure to: (1) deliver a valid
purchase order or (2) pay the then-current renewal fees to
the Channel Partner or Licensor, as applicable.  
(b)  Licensee may terminate this Agreement for any reason by
giving Licensor sixty (60) days advance written notice.

limitation, by way of merger of Licensee with or into any
other person or entity), or the sale of Licensee's business,
or any other transaction or series of related transactions in
which the security holders of Licensee immediately prior to
such transaction(s) do not hold at least a majority of the
outstanding voting securities of Licensee immediately after
the transaction(s); or (vi) any other attempted assignment of
this Agreement by Licensee without prior written approval by
Licensor.  
(d)  If the Agreement is terminated, no refund will be due to
Licensee and Licensee will immediately uninstall the
Program(s) from the computer(s) on which it is installed and
will certify to Licensor in writing that the Program(s) is
uninstalled and all copies thereof have either been destroyed
or returned to Licensor or the Channel Partner.  Licensee
will immediately return to Licensor or the Channel Partner
any Program Confidential Information and Licensor's Other
Confidential Information, which terms are defined in
Section 5.

4.  PAYMENT
	Licensee agrees to pay the license fees for the
Program(s).  If a Channel Partner provided the Program(s) to
Licensee, payments made by Licensee under this Agreement will
be paid to the Channel Partner unless Licensee is otherwise
notified in writing by Licensor, in which event Licensee
agrees to make payments as specified by Licensor.  If Licensor
provided the Program(s) to Licensee, payments will be made to
Licensor.  Fees are exclusive of all value added taxes, sales
taxes, use taxes, and the like. Licensee will pay all taxes
associated with the Program(s), exclusive of any tax based on
the income of Licensor or the Channel Partner.  If claiming a
tax exemption, Licensee must provide a valid tax exemption
certificate.

5.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
(a)  Licensee hereby acknowledges that the Program(s) contains
confidential and proprietary information, including trade
secrets, owned by Licensor or its subsidiaries, affiliates or
suppliers (the "Program Confidential Information").  Program
Confidential Information will remain the property of Licensor. 
Licensee will not disclose the Program Confidential
Information at any time during or after the term of this
Agreement, except to the extent permitted by Section 2(a), and
will use the Program Confidential Information only in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Licensee will
use the same degree of care, but not less than reasonable
care, to protect the confidentiality of the Program
Confidential Information.
(b)  Information other than Program Confidential Information
that is marked as confidential or proprietary ("Other
Confidential Information") may be disclosed by one party (the
"Disclosing Party") to the other party (the "Receiving Party")
under this Agreement.  If initially disclosed orally or
visually, Other Confidential Information must be identified as
confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure and a
written summary thereof, that is marked as confidential or
proprietary, must be provided to recipient within 15 days of
the initial disclosure or Section 5(c) will not apply to such
information.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, reports and other
information related to Licensor's or its subsidiaries',
affiliates' or suppliers' business plans, strategies,
technology, research and development, current and prospective
customers, billing records, and products or services will be
deemed Other Confidential Information to which Section(5)
applies even if not so marked or identified.  Other
Confidential Information will remain the property of the
Disclosing Party.  
(c)  The parties agree that, for a period of three (3) years
from the date any Other Confidential Information is disclosed,
the Receiving Party will protect the confidentially of the
Disclosing Party's Other Confidential Information using the
same degree of care, but not less than reasonable care, as it
uses to protect its own similar confidential and proprietary
information, and will not (i) use the Disclosing Party's Other
Confidential Information in any way, for its own account or
the account of any third party, except for the exercise of its
rights and performance of its obligations under this
Agreement, or (ii) disclose any such Other Confidential
Information to any party, other than furnishing such Other
Confidential Information to (a) its employees and consultants
who are required to have access to such Confidential
Information in connection with the exercise of its rights and
performance of its obligations under this Agreement and (b)
professional advisers; provided that such employees,
consultants and professional advisers are bound by written
agreements containing confidentiality obligations equivalent
to the confidentiality obligations of the Receiving Party
under this Section 5 or, for professional advisers, ethical
duties equivalent to the confidentiality obligations of the
Receiving Party under this Section 5. 
(d)  The obligations of this Section 5 will not extend to any
Other Confidential Information which:
(i)  was lawfully known to Receiving Party prior to receipt
from the Disclosing Party; or
(ii)  enters the public domain through no wrongful act or
breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party; or
(iii)  is received by Receiving Party from a third party
having a legal right to disclose such information; or
(iv)  is developed independently by the Receiving Party
without use of or access to the Disclosing Party's Other
Confidential Information; or
(v)  is identified by Disclosing Party as no longer being
confidential.
(e)  Receiving Party has the burden of proving the exceptions
in Section 5(d). 
(f)  Licensee agrees that Licensor may use Licensee's name and
corporate logo to identify it as a user of Licensor's software
from time to time in Licensor's marketing and other similar
materials.

6.	WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF REMEDY
(a)  Licensor warrants to Licensee that the Program(s) will
substantially perform as specified in Licensor's most current
user's manual(s) ("Manual") applicable to the Program(s) for
ninety (90) days from the Effective Date of Program(s) and for
the period of time during which Licensee is entitled to
receive TECS for a Program(s) ("Warranty Period").  The
warranty provided in this Section 6 will only apply to the
most current release of the Program(s) provided to Licensee. 
This warranty will not apply if Licensor has notified Licensee
in writing that Licensor no longer supports the operating
system version on which such Program(s) is licensed.
(b)  Licensor and the Channel Partner and their respective
subsidiaries, affiliates and suppliers do not warrant the
accuracy or the applicability of the results obtained from the
use of the Program(s) or the Manual.  No other documents or
oral conversations, statements or representations will be
offered by Licensee as evidence to explain, expand, alter, add
to or invalidate the express warranties set forth above.
(c)  The warranty and remedies expressed herein are sole and
exclusive and extend only to Licensee itself.  Licensor will
not be responsible for any breach of warranty caused by (i)
modifications (or attempted modifications) to the Program(s)
made by or on behalf of Licensee, whether authorized or
unauthorized, or (ii) any combination of the Program(s) with
any other software, or (iii) any use of the Program(s) other
than on the Designated Network, or (iv) use of other than the
most-current release of the Program(s) and Manual.
(d)  THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 6(a) OF THIS
AGREEMENT IS IN LIEU OF, AND LICENSOR AND THE CHANNEL PARTNER
AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES AND SUPPLIERS
DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, CONDITIONS, OR
REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN), WITH
RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM(S) OR ANY PART THEREOF, INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS OR
SUITABILITY FOR ANY PURPOSE (whether or not Licensor or the
Channel Partner and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates
and suppliers know, have reason to know, have been advised, or
are otherwise in fact aware of any such purpose), whether
alleged to arise by law, by reason of custom or usage in the
trade, or by course of dealing.  In addition, Licensor and the
Channel Partner and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates
and suppliers expressly disclaim any warranty or
representation to any person other than Licensee with respect
to the Program(s) or any part thereof.
(e)  In the event that Program(s) fails to perform
substantially as warranted in this Agreement, Licensor's sole
obligation to Licensee will be, at Licensor's option, to:
(i)  Provide a correction or work-around to correct the
breach; or
(ii)  Modify the Program(s) to conform substantially to the
Manual; or
(iii)  If the Manual is in error, modify the Manual to
accurately reflect the Program(s)'s intended functionality and
actual operation; or
(iv)  Permit Licensee to terminate the Agreement and refund to
Licensee a pro rata share of the license fees for the
Program(s).  For purposes of calculating this refund for a
Paid-Up License, a Paid-Up License will be deemed to have a
term of three (3) years.
(f) 	LICENSEE'S REMEDIES AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION ARE THE
SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES TO WHICH LICENSEE IS ENTITLED.

7.  INDEMNIFICATION
(a)  Licensor will defend at its expense any claim, suit or
proceeding (each, a "Claim") brought against Licensee by any
third party to the extent such Claim asserts that the
Program(s) infringes or conflicts with any rights of such
third party under copyright laws of any country that is a
signatory to the Berne Convention, any trademark issued under
the laws of the United States, any State of the United States
or any member state of the European Union or any trade secret
laws of the United States, any State of the United States or
any member state of the European Union, and Licensor will pay
all costs and damages finally awarded against Licensee by a
court of competent jurisdiction as a result of any such claim;
provided, however, that Licensee (i) promptly notifies
Licensor in writing of such Claim; (ii) promptly gives
Licensor the right to control and direct the investigation,
preparation, defense and settlement of such Claim, with
counsel of Licensor's own choosing (provided that Licensee
will have the right to reasonably participate, at its own
expense, in the defense of any such Claim); and (iii) gives
assistance and full cooperation for the defense of same.  If a
Program(s) is, or in Licensor's opinion, might be held to
infringe as set forth above, Licensor may, at its option, (i)
replace or modify the Program(s) so as to avoid infringement,
(ii) procure the right for Licensee to continue the use and
resale of the Program(s), or (iii) terminate any licenses to
the Program(s) and/or this Agreement and require Licensee to
return the Program(s) to Licensor, in which event Licensor
will refund to Licensee a pro rata portion of the amounts paid
for such Program(s).  For the purposes of calculating this
refund for a Paid-Up License, a Paid-Up License will be deemed
to have a term of three (3) years.  FOR PURPOSES OF THIS
SECTION 7(a), PROGRAM(S) WILL NOT INCLUDE ANY COMPONENTS OR
PRODUCTS, WHETHER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE, MANUFACTURED BY A
THIRD PARTY.  
(b)  The foregoing indemnity will not apply to any Claim based
upon or arising from (i) use of the Program(s) in a manner for
which it was not designed or not in accordance with the
Manual, (ii) use of the Program(s), when use of a subsequent
software release which Licensor has made commercially 
available would have avoided such infringement; or (iii)
Licensee's continued use of the Program(s) subsequent to
receipt of notice of any claimed infringement. This Section 7
represents the sole and exclusive remedy of Licensee and the
entire liability and obligation of Licensor with respect to
infringement or claims of infringement or misappropriation of
any intellectual property right (including any trade secret)
by Licensor or by its operation, use or receipt of the
Program(s).

8.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNITY
(a) SUBJECT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR,
CHANNEL PARTNER, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES
AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER
PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, CONSEQUENTIAL,
EXEMPLARY OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES.  Regardless of
whether or not the parties have been advised of the likelihood
of such damages or losses, said limitation of liability
includes but is not limited to lost profits (whether direct or
indirect), revenues, anticipated savings, goodwill, business
opportunities, wasted or lost production and/or management's
or employees' time, or loss of or corruption of software data,
or database configuration, or use of the Program(s) by
Licensee, or inability of Licensee to use the Program(s), or
inaccurate output, or Licensor's breach of this Agreement
whether in contract, negligence, tort, or under any other
theory of liability. In no event will Licensor's and the
Channel Partner's aggregate liability to Licensee exceed the
greater of: (i) the fees paid by Licensee under the Agreement
or (ii) 5,000.00 U.S. Dollars.  Licensee acknowledges that
given all the circumstances, the limits on Licensor's
liability are reasonable because of (amongst other matters)
the likelihood that without those limitations the amount of
damages awardable to Licensee for a breach by Licensor or
Channel Partner of this Agreement may be disproportionately
greater than the license fees paid or payable for the
Program(s).  Licensee acknowledges it has taken out adequate
insurance to cover its risks under this Agreement.  For the
avoidance of doubt, Licensee is entirely responsible for
keeping full back up copies of its software, data and database
configurations in accordance with best industry practice.
(b) Each of Licensor's and Channel Partner's (and their
respective subsidiaries', affiliates' and suppliers')
employees, agents, and sub-contractors may rely upon and
enforce the exclusions and restrictions of liability in this
Section 8 in that person's own name and for that person's own
benefit, as if the words "and their employees, agents, sub
contractors, and suppliers" followed the words "Licensor and
the Channel Partner" wherever it appears in this Section 8. 
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither party limits its liability (if any) to the
other party for any matter which it would be illegal for that
party to exclude or to attempt to exclude its liability, but
nothing in this clause confers any right or remedy upon the
other party to which it would not otherwise be entitled.
(d) The Program(s) is a mathematical analysis tool intended to
assist Licensee in Licensee's development and design processes
and requires considerable skill and judgment for its correct
use and for the interpretation of the computed results. The
Program(s) is not intended to be nor is it a substitute for
rigorous and comprehensive prototype or other testing by
Licensee of products prior to production and sale. Licensee
agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Licensor, Channel
Partner, subsidiaries and affiliates, along with its and their
officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") harmless from and against all losses,
damages, liability (including reasonable attorneys' fees)
incurred by such Indemnified Parties as a result of Licensee's
use of the Program(s); provided, however that such
indemnification obligations will not extend to (i) claims for
which Licensor is required to indemnify Licensee under Section
7 or (ii) claims arising out of Licensor's willful misconduct.


9.	TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT (TECS)
(a)  TECS will consist of (i) reasonable telephone or email
support ("Customer Support"); and (ii) Program releases or
corrections provided by Licensor without additional charge to
TECS customers generally ("Technical Enhancements").  Customer
Support will be provided solely to the ASC.  The ASC will
provide first-level support to all of Licensee's users
permitted to use the Program(s) under the terms of this
Agreement.  Licensee may change the ASC at any time upon
written notice to the Channel Partner or, if the Program(s)
were not obtained from a Channel Partner, to Licensor. 
Customer Support will be provided by the Channel Partner
unless otherwise specified by Licensor.  Technical
Enhancements will be provided by Licensor at such times as
determined solely by Licensor. 
(b)  During the period of time in which Licensee is entitled
to receive TECS for a Program, Licensee may request three (3)
replacement License Keys due to a change of the Designated
Network within one year from the TECS effective date at no
additional charge.  Additional replacement License Key(s) or
replacement License Key(s) during the period of time in which
TECS is not current, may be provided in consideration for
payment of Licensor's then-current administrative fee. 
(c)  For a Lease License, the annual TECS fee is included in
the Lease License fee.  
(d)  For a Paid-Up License, telephone or email assistance for
Program installation will be provided without charge for
thirty (30) days from the Effective Date of Program(s).  In
consideration for payment of the then-current TECS fees, TECS
for a Paid-Up License will be provided by the Channel Partner
or Licensor.  TECS will automatically renew at the then
current renewal fees for a renewal term equal to the duration
of the immediately preceding term unless Licensee, Channel
Partner, or Licensor gives prior written notice of its intent
to terminate TECS no later than 30 days prior to the end of
the TECS term.  TECS will terminate automatically upon
Licensee's failure to: (i) deliver a valid purchase order or
(2) pay the then-current TECS renewal fees to Channel Partner
or Licensor. In the event TECS is terminated prior to the end
of the term, no refund will be due to Licensee for any portion
of the prepaid TECS fee.  
(e)  Licensor and the Channel Partner will have no obligation
to provide TECS: (i) for other than the two most recent
commercially available releases of each Program(s); (ii) for
any Program(s) that have been altered, damaged or modified by
Licensee or on Licensee's behalf; or (iii) for any problems
caused by Licensee's negligence or use of the Program(s) other
than in accordance with the Manual and this Agreement. 
(f)  Licensor may, from time to time, post notices of Class3
Errors in Program(s) on its Customer Portal website (currently

Licensor may decide in its sole discretion upon providing
notice on the Customer Portal website.  The ASC will promptly
notify all of Licensee's users of the Program(s) of Class3
Errors in the Program(s).  
(g)  In the event that TECS are discontinued by Licensee and
the Licensee later wishes to reinstate TECS, reinstatement may
be permitted by Licensor in its sole discretion and, in
addition to the applicable TECS fee, a fee will be charged by
Licensor for reinstatement in an amount to be determined by
Licensor that is no less than the total fees that would have
been payable had TECS remained in effect during the period in
which it was discontinued.

manner whatsoever, even if such purchase order or other
standardized business form provides that it takes precedence
over any other agreement between the parties; and, any
acknowledgment, written or oral, of any such purchase order or
standardized business form is not recognized as a subsequent
writing and will not act as acceptance of such terms.
